# Challenge 1: Refactor Horiseon Code
##### The task this week was to take a pre-existing code and refactor it to meet a user's story and acceptance criteria. You will find full functioning links, consolidated CCS selectors and properties, user accessibility, semantic structure of HTML elements and comments before each section of the page.




#### **The user's story:**
##### -   AS A marketing agency
##### -   I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
##### -   SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

#### **The acceptance criteria:**
##### - GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
##### - WHEN I view the source code
##### - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
##### - WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
##### - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
##### - WHEN I view the image elements
##### - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
##### - WHEN I view the heading attributes
##### - THEN they fall in sequential order
##### - WHEN I view the title element
##### - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
